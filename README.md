I - Tide Pools
When the ebbing tide retreats along the rocky shoreline
It leaves a trail of tide pools in a short-lived galaxy
Each microcosmic planet a complete society
A simple kind of mirror to reflect upon our own
All the busy little creatures chasing out their destinies
Living in their pools they soon forget about the sea...

Wheel within wheels in a spiral array -
A pattern so grand and complex
Time after time we lose sight of the way -
Our causes can't see their effects
